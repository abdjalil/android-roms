*PROCEED WITH CAUTION*

= Preparing your Phone to get Root =

*_- BEFORE ATTEMPTING THIS PROCESS I WOULD HAVE A FULLY CHARGED BATTERY OR THE PHONE PLUGED INTO A POWER SOURCE -_* 

1 Format your phone's SD card to FAT32 mode:
      Hook your phone up to your computer using a USB cable and then wait for the notification to show up in your title bar of your phone.
      Click the notification, and then click "Mount".
      A new removable disk should show up on your computer. Right click it and select Format, and select FAT32 as the file system type.
2 Download and unzip the RC29 image file, unzip the file and copy the "_DREAMIMG.nbh_" file to the root of your SD card.  Confirm the name of the file is exactly this: _DREAMIMG.nbh_
      Location of the RC29 Image: http://android-roms.googlecode.com/files/DREAIMG-RC29.zip
3 Turn the device power off.<br>
4 Hold Camera button, and press Power button to entry bootloader mode.
      You should see a gray/white screen with instructions to flash your phone with the update on your SD card. If you don't see that, make sure you followed the instructions properly.
5 As per the on-screen instructions, press the Power button to start the upgrade process.  

<h3>*<font color="#FF0000">DURING THIS PROCESS DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO INTERRUPT THIS PROCESS!</font>*</h3>
