1 Mount your SDCard to your PC<br>
2 On your SDCard change to the nandroid/HT840GZ30985<br>
3 Inside this folder you will see another folder the first 8 digits of this folder name is the date it was created in the YYYYMMDD format and the last four are the time.<br>
4 Copy this entire folder to your PC and save it.  As you make more backups to your phone repeat this process.<br>
_NOTE:I tend to append the build the backup is of i.e. 20090429-0421_ADP_Hv15_r2 So I know this build is the ADP build by haykuro version 2._<br>
