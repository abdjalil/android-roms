#summary Secret Star Codes.
#labels Dailer_Codes

= Introduction =

This is a list of codes that can be entered into the dialer to output the listed information.

= Guidelines =

  * There are many different star/pound codes. T-Mobile will only confirm the codes listed below. T-Mobile does not guarantee the validity or functionality of codes not included on the list below.
  * Not all codes function on the T-Mobile's network as they may refer to services (such as "barring") that T-Mobile does not currently offer
  * Star codes do not modify any setting permanently or do anything that can't be corrected by another code or by Technical Support making changes
  * GSM Network Codes are part of the GSM Worldwide Standard and are understood by all GSM networks. These star codes control functions such as call forwarding, caller ID, etc. 

= Manufacturer or device specific codes =

  * These codes may be used to alter the internal software settings of the device, perform resets, clear memory, or perform other hardware-specific functions that have nothing to do with the GSM network
  * Important: These codes to customers. They may permanently alter the software or hardware settings in the device.

= To execute a star code/pound code =

  #  Find the function from the list below
  #  Dial the code on the handset
  #  Press the SEND key
